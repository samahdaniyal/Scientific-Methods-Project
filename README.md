**Health Expenditure and Mortality: Exploring Correlations in Least Developed Countries**

Project Overview:
This research investigates the correlation between infant mortality rate, life expectancy, and health expenditure as a percentage of GDP in least developed countries (LDCs) over time. Conducted as part of the CORE-200 Scientific Methods course at Habib University, the study analyzes longitudinal data from 45 LDCs spanning 2000 to 2023 to provide insights into sustainable health outcomes and inform policy decisions.

Key Features:
Comprehensive Dataset: Includes economic and health-related indicators (e.g., GDP growth, infant mortality rate, life expectancy) from World Bank Open Data.
Advanced Methods: Utilized Python, SQL, and Power BI for data preprocessing, integration, and visualization.
Focus on Impact: Highlights actionable strategies for improving public health through effective resource allocation.

Key Objectives:
Evaluate whether higher health expenditure as a percentage of GDP reduces infant mortality rates.
Analyze the relationship between health spending and life expectancy.
Provide evidence-based recommendations for healthcare investment strategies in LDCs.

Methodology:
Data Cleaning & Integration: Structured data into an MSSQL database using Python for consistent and scalable analysis.
Visualization: Created longitudinal trend charts and correlation heatmaps in Power BI and Python.
Statistical Analysis: Performed correlation analyses to explore relationships between variables and identify trends.

Results:
Health expenditure strongly inversely correlates with infant mortality rates (correlation coefficient: -0.80).
Increased health expenditure as a percentage of GDP contributes to improved life expectancy.
Minimal health spending increases significantly impact mortality reductions in regions with limited healthcare systems.
